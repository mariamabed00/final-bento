                  Gaining Independence with Food Allergies

                    <p class="mot-p">I’m 15 years old and I’ve been severely allergic to nearly all tree nuts since I was 2 years old. Throughout my childhood, my mum has been there for me during every allergic reaction I’ve had, but last winter, in the run-up to Christmas, I had to go it alone for the first time without my mum.  

                      I was at a friend’s house and accepted a homemade cupcake that I was told was definitely safe for me to eat. After taking the first bite, I could tell something was very wrong - my throat suddenly felt itchy and tight and it was getting worse. I told my friend what was happening and got my EpiPen kit out of my bag. Luckily, my antihistamine worked quickly so I didn’t have to inject myself with my EpiPen, which I would have done if my symptoms had gotten worse - thank goodness I didn’t have to! Even though I felt terrified at the time, I kept calm, and in this instance, the antihistamine was enough.
                      
                      But I didn’t say anything to anyone, and I didn’t tell my mum until just recently; I kept silent.
                      
                      I kept silent because I didn’t want my world to get any smaller because of my food allergies than it already was. I love my friends, but I also love and need my independence. I treasure it more than my friends do theirs because I have to fight for it every day. Gaining independence is a teenage ‘rite of passage’ but when you have food allergies it’s a much harder journey and I don’t want to feel restricted or have my food allergies become my identity. I want to be safe, but I also want to live my life to the full, and this is the burden I and many teenagers with allergies carry.
                      
                      I tell myself there are many ways to make myself feel more confident when facing challenges to be safe. For example, to practice beforehand what to say before entering a restaurant, or saying out loud,  ‘I have a food allergy.’ It’s something I don’t like saying but the more I say it, the easier it gets.
                      
                      Being a teenager is tough enough so remembering that I’m not alone on this journey, also really helps</p>

                    <p class="mot-p">Jack wants people and especially young people to feel more “comfortable” and more “confident” to talk about their food allergies.

                      Jack has had a nut allergy since he was 7 years old and says, he “...found it difficult to bring it up.” especially in front of friends, as he didn’t want to single himself out and be “...the only one with a problem.” With time, life experience and as he has got older, he says it's become a lot easier.
                      
                      Jack wants to get the message out to the next generation, that it is always better to be safe than hide your allergies. He captured the nation's heart in season 4 of the ITV2 hit reality show, Love Island, in 2018; we think it is fair to say that his food allergy hasn’t held him back.
                      
                      Going on to forge a career in music as a DJ & Producer; Jack’s food allergy doesn’t define him. His nut allergy shapes his daily decision-making when it comes to travelling and food safety, but he fearlessly travels the globe touring, making his dreams come true.

She decided to start her own bakery, dedicated to making delicious treats that were completely nut-free. Her bakery became a huge success, and she inspired other food allergic people to follow their dreams and pursue their passions.</p>
